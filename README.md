Ecommerce Customer Insights: Mobile App vs Website Analysis Using Linear Regression

This project explores customer behavior data for an ecommerce fashion company based in New York City. The company offers both online and in-store experiences, and they are seeking data-driven guidance on whether to invest more in their mobile app or website platform.

The dataset includes key customer attributes:

Avg. Session Length: Average session time with in-store stylists

Time on App: Time spent on the mobile app
